###TODO: update references

##Algorithm Similarity

Algorithms are universally presented in groups by similarity in terms of function or form. For example, tree based methods, and neural network inspired methods. This is a useful grouping method, but it is not perfect. There are still algorithms that could just as easily fit into multiple categories like Learning Vector Quantization that is both a neural network inspired method and an instance-based method. There are also categories that have the same name that describes the problem and the class of algorithm such as Regression and Clustering. As such, you will see variations on the way algorithms are grouped depending on the source you check. Like machine learning algorithms themselves, there is no perfect model, just a good enough model.

###Regression

Regression is concerned with modelling the relationship between variables that is iteratively refined using a measure of error in the predictions made by the model. Regression methods are a work horse of statistics and have been cooped into statistical machine learning. This may be confusing because we can use regression to refer to the class of problem and the class of algorithm. Really, regression is a process. Some example algorithms are:

* Ordinary Least Squares
* Logistic Regression
* Stepwise Regression
* Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS)
* Locally Estimated Scatterplot Smoothing (LOESS)

##Instance-based Methods

Instance based learning model a decision problem with instances or examples of training data that are deemed important or required to the model. Such methods typically build up a database of example data and compare new data to the database using a similarity measure in order to find the best match and make a prediction. For this reason, instance-based methods are also called winner-take all methods and memory-based learning. Focus is put on representation of the stored instances and similarity measures used between instances.

* k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN)
* Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ)
* Self-Organizing Map (SOM)

##Regularization Methods

An extension made to another method (typically regression methods) that penalizes models based on their complexity, favoring simpler models that are also better at generalizing. I have listed Regularization methods here because they are popular, powerful and generally simple modifications made to other methods.

* Ridge Regression
* Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO)
* Elastic Net

##Decision Tree Learning

Decision tree methods construct a model of decisions made based on actual values of attributes in the data. Decisions fork in tree structures until a prediction decision is made for a given record. Decision trees are trained on data for classification and regression problems.

* Classification and Regression Tree (CART)
* Iterative Dichotomiser 3 (ID3)
* C4.5
* Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID)
* Decision Stump
* Random Forest
* Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS)
* Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)

##Bayesian

Bayesian methods are those that are explicitly apply Bayesâ€™ Theorem for problems such as classification and regression.

* Naive Bayes
* Averaged One-Dependence Estimators (AODE)
* Bayesian Belief Network (BBN)

##Kernel Methods

Kernel Methods are best known for the popular method Support Vector Machines which is really a constellation of methods in and of itself. Kernel Methods are concerned with mapping input data into a higher dimensional vector space where some classification or regression problems are easier to model.

* Support Vector Machines (SVM)
* Radial Basis Function (RBF)
* Linear Discriminate Analysis (LDA)

##Clustering Methods

Clustering, like regression describes the class of problem and the class of methods. Clustering methods are typically organized by the modelling approaches such as centroid-based and hierarchal. All methods are concerned with using the inherent structures in the data to best organize the data into groups of maximum commonality.

* k-Means
* Expectation Maximisation (EM)

##Association Rule Learning

Association rule learning are methods that extract rules that best explain observed relationships between variables in data. These rules can discover important and commercially useful associations in large multidimensional datasets that can be exploited by an organisation.

* Apriori algorithm
* Eclat algorithm

##Artificial Neural Networks

Artificial Neural Networks are models that are inspired by the structure and/or function of biological neural networks. They are a class of pattern matching that are commonly used for regression and classification problems but are really an enormous subfield comprised of hundreds of algorithms and variations for all manner of problem types. Some of the classically popular methods include (I have separated Deep Learning from this category):

* Perceptron
* Back-Propagation
* Hopfield Network
* Self-Organizing Map (SOM)
* Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ)

##Deep Learning

Deep Learning methods are a modern update to Artificial Neural Networks that exploit abundant cheap computation. The are concerned with building much larger and more complex neural networks, and as commented above, many methods are concerned with semi-supervised learning problems where large datasets contain very little labelled data.

* Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM)
* Deep Belief Networks (DBN)
* Convolutional Network
* Stacked Auto-encoders

##Dimensionality Reduction

Like clustering methods, Dimensionality Reduction seek and exploit the inherent structure in the data, but in this case in an unsupervised manner or order to summarise or describe data using less information. This can be useful to visualize dimensional data or to simplify data which can then be used in a supervized learning method.

* Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
* Partial Least Squares Regression (PLS)
* Sammon Mapping
* Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)
* Projection Pursuit

##Ensemble Methods

Ensemble methods are models composed of multiple weaker models that are independently trained and whose predictions are combined in some way to make the overall prediction. Much effort is put into what types of weak learners to combine and the ways in which to combine them. This is a very powerful class of techniques and as such is very popular.

* Boosting
* Bootstrapped Aggregation (Bagging)
* AdaBoost
* Stacked Generalization (blending)
* Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
* Random Forest
